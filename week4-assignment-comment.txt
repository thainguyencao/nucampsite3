I am so sorry because I cannot attend the class last Saturday. My laptop had a broken sceen so I must change another laptop.
I finished challenge 1,2,3
But challenge 3 had problems. The css file could not be updated from scss file.
Maybe I need your help on this Saturday.
Thank you so much
Have a happy week

Best regards,
Thai Nguyen
